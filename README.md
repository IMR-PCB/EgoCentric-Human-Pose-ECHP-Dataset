- [x] Images from the third-person view and the egocentric view for a self-supervised learning.
- [x] Diverse real-world scenarios.
- [x] Different subjects performing many daily actions in different body textures.

## Introduction
To address the challenges in egocentric 3D pose estimation, we propose a real-world egocentric human action dataset, named ECHA, using a head-mounted GoPro camera with a fisheye lens. The training and validation sets of the ECHA dataset consist of **30** video sequences(**fps=30Hz**) recorded in **8** diverse real-world indoor/outdoor scenes with **10** different daily actions performed by **9** subjects in **20** different body textures. The ten daily actions include: squatting, walking, dancing, stretching, waving, boxing, kicking, touching, clamping, knocking. The test set of the ECHA dataset consists of **7** video sequences by 4 subjects with new body textures captured by a multi-camera motion capture system with ground truth annotations.
